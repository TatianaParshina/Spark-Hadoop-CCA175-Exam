# 1 Import all tables from mysql database into hdfs as avro data files. use compression and the compression codec should be snappy. data warehouse directory should be retail_stage.db

sqoop import

	--warehouse-dir retail_stage.db
	--compress
	--compression-codec snappy

#2 Create a metastore table that should point to the orders data imported by sqoop job above. Name the table orders_sqoop. 
	
	#copy file from hdfs to local folder
	hadoop fs -get /user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db/orders/part-m-00000.avro

	#get schema from avro file (local machine)

# 3 Write query in hive that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. select data from orders_sqoop. 
Run this query in Hive. 

	hive

	select * from orders_sqoop
	where order_date in (select order_date, count(order_id) 
	from orders_sqoop s3
	group by order_date
	order by 2 desc limit 1)


# 4 query table in impala that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. select data from order_sqoop. 

	#run impala
	impala-shell

	#Whenever you change table through Hive run:
	Invalidate metadata

	select * from orders_sqoop
	where order_date in (select order_date, count(order_id) 
	from orders_sqoop s3
	group by order_date
	order by 2 desc limit 1)


# 5 Now create a table named retail.orders_avro in hive stored as avro, the table should have same table definition as order_sqoop. Additionally, this new table should be partitioned by the order month i.e -> year-order_month.(example: 2014-01)

	hive
	create database retail;

	create table retail.orders_avro
	(order_id int,
	order_date date)
	partition by (order_month string)
	stored as avro;

# 6 Load data into orders_avro table from orders_sqoop table.	

	insert overwrite table orders_avro partition(order_month)
	select order_id, order_date, order_date as order_month 
	from default.orders_sqoop;


# 7 Write query in hive that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. select data from orders_avro

	hive

	select * from orders_sqoop
	where order_date in (select order_date, count(order_id) 
	from orders_sqoop s3
	group by order_date
	order by 2 desc limit 1)
